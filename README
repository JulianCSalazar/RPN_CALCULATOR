This repository holds code to run an RPN calculator using the Arduino IDE.
The code is primarily practice using a stack data type in C. The code
provided is replicated from code I made to operate an RPN calculator using
an UNO32 microcontoller. The original program was made as part of a coding
assignment provided by the University of California, Santa Cruz's
CMPE013/L courses held by Professor Max Dunne.

Operation:
To run this code, place the myRPN.ino file in a folder called myRPN. The
Stack.c and Stack.h files must be places in a folder called Stack which
should be placed in Documents/Arduino/libraries to be found as a library
for the Arduino IDE. When the code in myRPN.ino is run, operation of the
calculator is done in the Arduino Serial Monitor.

NOTE on the Stack.h file:
The original Stack.h was provided by the course but was lost. I later
recreated the file to the best of my memory based on macros and functions
I saw from the Stack.c file, but in no way claim ownership of the code.
All function content provided in all other files other than the Stack.h
file are original to me. The Stack.h file only provided the desired
functions, parameters, and return types needed as part of the course
assignment.
